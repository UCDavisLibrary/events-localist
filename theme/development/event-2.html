  <div class="em-about_description">
    <p>On the first of each month, Students 4 Music presents "Concerts on the Quad," which allows club members the chance to perform a piece of their choice. But this isn't just any "open mic night" -- each month you'll be able to purchase snacks from a local food truck and check out creations from our very own Students 4 Art club's maker's fair. 15% of all proceeds will go towards Students 4 Music's community outreach program!</p>
